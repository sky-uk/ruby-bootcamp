# Ruby Bootcamp


## Introduction

Welcome to the Ruby Bootcamp. The bootcamp is a conversion course, designed to take programmers who are versed in another language and teach them Ruby.

Things covered in this course include:

* Debugging
* Variables
* Strings
* Collections
* Classes
* Modules
* Blocks and procs
* RSpec
* Rake
* Cucumber
* Rack
* Sinatra
* Rails

## Getting Started

The course revolves around the [course dashboard](http://prezi.com/adnfktg98mli/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share). This is an interactive presentation that contains the material you will be learning, the exercises to help cement that learning and the suggested workflow to go through the exercises.

This repository contains exercises to compliment the presentation material, which you can work through at your own pace. Once you've completed the presentation and these exercises, you can consider the course completed! If you need more material, check the [final project](project/readme.md).

Before getting started, you may need to [setup your environment](environment.md).


## What's in the Bootcamp?


### Dashboard

As mentioned above, the [course dashboard](http://prezi.com/adnfktg98mli/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) contains the outline for the material for the course. It prescribes all of the things to read and do and the order to do them in.

You should use the dashboard to guide you through the course.


### Exercises

The exercises for the course can be found in the [exercises](./exercises) directory. The course [dashboard](#dashboard) will take you through the content and tell you which exercise to do when to complement what you are reading/watching.


### Workshops

There will be guided workshops throughout the course. These will give you a deeper understanding of how the things you are learning glue together.

* [Logical statements](workshops/logical-statements/readme.md)
* [Exceptions](workshops/exceptions/readme.md)
* [About blocks](workshops/about-blocks/readme.md)
* [Building a JSON API wrapper with `Net::HTTP`](workshops/json-api-wrapper/readme.md)
* [Sinatra Introduction](workshops/sinatra)
* [Sinatra Testing with `Rack::Test` and `RSpec`](workshops/rack-test/readme.md)
* [Domain Specific Language (DSL)](workshops/domain-specific-language/readme.md)
* [Building a Gem](workshops/building-a-gem/readme.md)


### Final Project

At the end of the course there is a larger project for you to get your teeth in to once you've completed all exercises.

This will put to use all the things you've learnt throughout the bootcamp. You can [read more about]((project/readme.md)) it here.


## Notes

* This course is still be actively developed so if something is not clear please check in with your trainers to find out what's next
* This course assumes that you don't know Ruby but have are experienced in another object oriented programming language, know TDD and at least one testing framework
* Missing one of these things? Although it's not the core remit of the course to teach OO or TDD you will be doing lots of it and will have real opportunity to get stuck even more new things
